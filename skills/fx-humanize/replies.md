# Replies

Read this when the text is a reply and you can see the conversation around it.

A model writes for a reader who shares no context, because that fits the widest range of cases. A reply in a thread has a reader who already knows the background. Act on this pattern when you can see the surrounding conversation, or when the text plainly is a reply. If you cannot tell, ask or leave the text alone.

### 26. Re-explaining what the reader knows

**Watch for:** a short reply that restates the problem, walks through the diagnosis, and lays out the evidence before it reaches the decision; a query, command, or set of numbers included to prove a plan will work; background the other person wrote or already agreed to; the answer itself sitting in the last line.
**Problem:** In a reply the reader already has the context, so rebuilding it adds nothing and buries the point. Each sentence can read fine on its own, so this survives sentence-level cleanup. Lead with the decision and keep only the reasoning that would change whether the reader agrees: usually one fact they lack and any link they need to act. The diagnosis and the proof that a plan will work belong in the ticket or document that follows; a reviewer raising a topic is not a request for the full write-up.
**Before:**
> Yeah, you're right, this works around the issue rather than fixing it. The real fix is in `MergeService`: when we move a child under a new parent, it should update `pipeline_id` along with `parent_id`. We can backfill the bad rows from the audit log with `Change.where(field: "pipeline_id", source: "merge")`. I checked QA: 123 past merges, only 6 rows wrong now, so the cleanup is small.
>
> Since `MergeService` is shared and not specific to this account, I'd rather open a separate ticket than widen this PR. The fallback here is fine to keep until then.
**After:**
> Agreed, this is a workaround. Fixing it properly in `MergeService` would widen this ticket well past its scope: it is shared code, so it means checking the merge flow for every account, plus a backfill for the rows that are already wrong.
>
> I'd rather keep this PR account specific and open a separate ticket for the `MergeService` fix and the backfill. Let me know if that works.
